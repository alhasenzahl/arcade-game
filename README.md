## Instructions

This game is played like the old arcade game Frogger.  The objective of the game is to get your player from the grass to the water without getting hit by one of the bugs along the way.  If you collide with a bug along the way, the player will be reset to the beginning.  You can move the player using the up, down, left, and right arrows on the keyboard.  You have five lives (denoted by the stars) to make across to the water as many times as you can.  Once you lose all five lives, the game will end and you will be prompted to play again.

To play the game for yourself, just load the index.html file into your browser and have some fun!

## Dependencies 

The dependencies for this game include the following: 1) A selection of images that are used to draw out the game board, the player, and the bugs.  2) On top of the app.js file, which is where the bug(enemy) and player(hero) objects code was written and is what creates the functionality of each object, there are also two other JavaScript files for the game resources.js and engine.js.  These JS files are what allow the game functionality to loop and continuously draw the game board until the game is finally won.

I referenced parts of Matthew Cranford's Arcade Game Walkthrough blogs for sections of this project when I was struggling to figure out certain functionalities of the game.
